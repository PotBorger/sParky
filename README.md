# 🌲🔥 sParky — Wildfire Prediction & Awareness App

**sParky** is a wildfire prediction and awareness application designed to help communities stay informed and safe during wildfire seasons. It combines real-time environmental data, geospatial visualization, and machine learning to predict wildfire behavior and assess its potential effects on **air quality**, **safety**, and **travel conditions**.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

Wildfires are growing more frequent and intense due to climate change, threatening lives, ecosystems, and air quality. **sParky** was created to make wildfire information more accessible and understandable. Instead of relying on scattered alerts, users can see **data-driven predictions** and **visual maps** of fire risks in their region.

The goal is not just to warn users about fires but to **help them understand the broader environmental impact**, empowering individuals, first responders, and local authorities to make informed decisions.

## 💡 How It Works

sParky integrates multiple technologies to provide accurate and meaningful insights:

* **AWS SageMaker** powers the machine learning model that predicts wildfire spread and risk based on environmental factors.
* **OpenWeather API** supplies real-time weather and air quality data such as wind speed, humidity, and pollutant levels.
* **AWS Location Service (GeoMap)** visualizes fire zones, smoke spread patterns, and at-risk areas on an interactive map.
* **Node.js** connects the model and data services through an efficient backend.
* **React** provides a user-friendly, dynamic interface for viewing live data and risk visualizations.

---

## 🌤️ Key Capabilities

* **Predictive Modeling:** Forecasts potential wildfire spread using machine learning trained on real-world data.
* **Environmental Awareness:** Displays local air quality and weather conditions that influence fire behavior.
* **Geospatial Visualization:** Maps wildfire risks and smoke trajectories with clear visual overlays.
* **User Context:** Personalizes information to the user’s current or selected region for relevant insights.

## 🧠 Project Vision

The vision behind **sParky** is to bridge the gap between scientific data and public awareness. By combining AI and environmental monitoring, the app aspires to make wildfire prediction more **transparent**, **accessible**, and **actionable**.

Ultimately, sParky represents a step toward smarter environmental technology — where data, AI, and design work together to **protect communities** and **promote sustainable awareness**.

---

## 🌱 Future Directions

In future versions, sParky may include:

* Integration with **NASA FIRMS** for live fire perimeter updates.
* **Historical trend analysis** of wildfire patterns.
* **Community reporting tools** for real-time field data.
* **Expanded accessibility support** for users in remote or high-risk areas.
